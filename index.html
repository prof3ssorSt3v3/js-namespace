        <h1>JavaScript Namespacing Exercise</h1>
        <p>Both sections of the course will be collaboratively building the scripts for this page. The main script for this page will loop through a list of usernames and load a single JavaScript file for each username. Every JavaScript file will be called namespace.js. If your username was <strong>abcd0001</strong> then the main script on this page would be trying to load the script http://abcd0001.edumedia.ca/mad9014/namespace/namespace.js</p>
        <p>Since there is a chance that another person's script file has errors that can prevent the page from loading, if you only want the main script and your script to load you can add your username to the querystring when loading this page. eg: http://griffis.edumedia.ca/mad9014/namespace/index.html?user=abcd0001</p>
        <p>If you add the user parameter to the querystring then the page will only load its own script plus that one JavaScript file.</p>
        <p>Your script must be namespaced using your own username, written in all caps. Your script needs to create a div, give it the CSS className "box", add your username as text, append the div to the element with the id "boxes", and then add three event listeners. The event listeners are for the click event, the mouseover event and the mouseout event. The mouseover and mouseout events should toggle the CSS className "highlight". The click event should change the colour of the border around the box.</p>
        <p>When you create your namespace in your JavaScript file, be sure to <strong>use var, not let</strong></p>
        <p>Scroll down to see all the boxes.</p>
        <div id="boxes">
            <div class="box">Steve &amp; Tony</div>
        </div>
